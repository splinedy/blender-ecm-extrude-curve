# ECM – Extrude Curve Modifier for Blender

![ECM Header](https://www.splinedynamics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ECM-Extrude-Curve-Modifier-infographics_792px.jpg)  

**Extrude Curve (ECM)** is a free and lightweight modifier for Blender that lets you extrude any curve into a 3D mesh in a fully **non-destructive** and **procedural** way, powered by Geometry Nodes.  

Instead of converting curves to meshes and losing flexibility, you can keep your curves editable while generating clean extrusions in real time.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Height Control** – set the extrusion distance directly.  
- **Segments** – define the number of divisions along the extrusion for smooth results.  
- **Caps** – enable or disable top and bottom caps with a single click.  
- **Supports Any Curve** – works with Bézier and NURBS, multiple splines in a single object.  
- **Clean Normals** – automatically handles mesh normals orientation.  
- **Non-destructive Workflow** – curves remain editable at all times.

## 🚀 Why Use ECM?
- Save time when working with vector logos, imported CAD drawings, floorplans, or any 2D shapes.  
- Perfect for ArchViz workflows requiring clean extrusions of technical drawings.  
- Keep maximum flexibility – no need to convert curves to mesh until the final stage.  
- Generate clean and consistent geometry without manual tweaks.  
- Simple, intuitive, and integrates seamlessly into Blender’s Modifier Stack.
